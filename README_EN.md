### 🚀 Quick Start: Pick the Version That Fits You

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### 🔥 Option A: Deep Openclaw Integration (recommended for developers)
> - **Openclaw is on fire 🔥🔥🔥 — Openclaw support has been added in two flavors, pick whichever suits you:**
> - [xiaohongshu-mcp-skills](https://github.com/autoclaw-cc/xiaohongshu-mcp-skills) (for users who already have this project deployed)
> - [xiaohongshu-skills](https://github.com/autoclaw-cc/xiaohongshu-skills) (ready to use out of the box)

> [!TIP]
> #### ✨ Option B: x-mcp Browser Extension (recommended for non-technical users / anyone who wants the simplest setup)
> - **Don't want to deal with Docker or set up a deployment environment? Try [xpzouying/x-mcp](https://github.com/xpzouying/x-mcp).**
> - **Zero configuration**: install the extension and it just works — no code, no proxy, no complicated environment setup.
> - **Safe and stable**: runs directly in your everyday browser (Chrome/Edge) on your local network, with no server IP risk, and it solves 90% of deployment errors.

</details>

**RedNote Basic Operation Knowledge**

- **Title: (Very Important) RedNote requires titles to not exceed 20 characters**
- **Content: (Very Important) Content cannot exceed 1000 characters**
- Currently supports both image-text and video posting: From a recommendation perspective, image-text posts get better traffic than video or pure text.
- (Low priority) Pure text support can be considered. 1. I personally feel pure text would greatly increase operation complexity; 2. Pure text has low value in my use scenarios.
- Tags: Now supported. Adding appropriate tags can bring more traffic.
- According to my practical experience, RedNote should allow **50 posts** per day.
- **(Very Important) RedNote does not allow the same account to login on multiple web platforms**. If you login to the current xiaohongshu-mcp, don't login to that account on other web platforms, otherwise it will "kick out" the current MCP account login. You can use the mobile app to check current account information.
- If your reach is low, first check whether your content contains banned words — there are plenty of free third-party tools you can search for.
- Never do traffic diversion or pure content scraping/reposting — these are exactly what the platform cracks down on.

**Risk Explanation**

1. This project is open-sourced based on another project of mine. The original project has been running stably for over a year without any account bans, only occasional cookie expiration requiring re-login.
2. I used Claude Code CLI integration and verified stable automated operation for several weeks before open-sourcing.
3. If an account has not completed real-name verification, especially a new account, it will usually trigger a **real-name verification** prompt (see the screenshot below). ⚠️ This is not an account ban — you would be asked to verify even without using the MCP. Once verified, the account works normally. It is recommended to complete verification before using this project.

## 1. Usage Tutorial

### 1.1. Quick Start (Recommended)

**Method 1: Download Pre-compiled Binaries**

Download pre-compiled binaries for your platform directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp/releases):

**Main Program (MCP Service):**

- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64`
- **Windows x64**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-windows-amd64.exe`
- **Linux x64**: `xiaohongshu-mcp-linux-amd64`

**Login Tool:**

- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64`
- **Windows x64**: `xiaohongshu-login-windows-amd64.exe`
- **Linux x64**: `xiaohongshu-login-linux-amd64`

> Only the three platforms above are supported. macOS Intel and Linux ARM64 are not supported.

Usage Steps:

```bash
# 1. First run the login tool
chmod +x xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64
./xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64

# 2. Then start the MCP service
chmod +x xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64
```

**⚠️ Important Note**: The headless browser will be automatically downloaded on first run (about 150MB), please ensure a stable network connection. Subsequent runs will not require re-downloading.

**Method 2: Build from Source**

<details>
<summary>Build from Source Details</summary>

Requires Golang environment. For installation instructions, please refer to [Golang Official Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Set Go domestic proxy source:

```bash
# Configure GOPROXY environment variable, choose one of the following three

# 1. Qiniu CDN
go env -w  GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct

# 2. Alibaba Cloud
go env -w GOPROXY=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/goproxy/,direct

# 3. Official
go env -w  GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io,direct
```

</details>

**Method 3: Using Docker Container (Simplest)**

<details>
<summary>Docker Deployment Details</summary>

Using Docker deployment is the simplest method, requiring no development environment installation.

**1. Pull Image from Docker Hub (Recommended)**

We provide pre-built Docker images that can be directly pulled from Docker Hub:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp
```

Docker Hub URL: [https://hub.docker.com/r/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp](https://hub.docker.com/r/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp)

**2. Start with Docker Compose (Recommended)**

We provide a pre-configured `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used directly:

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp/main/docker/docker-compose.yml

# Or if you've already cloned the project, enter the docker directory
cd docker

# Start service
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop service
docker compose stop
```

**3. Build Image Yourself (Optional)**

If you need to customize or modify the code, you can build the image yourself:

```bash
# Run in project root directory
docker build -t xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp .
```

**4. Configuration Notes**

The Docker version automatically:

- Configures the built-in browser and Chinese fonts
- Mounts `./data` for storing cookies and runtime data directories
- Mounts `./images` for storing publish images
- Exposes port 18060 for MCP connection

For detailed instructions, please refer to: [Docker Deployment Guide](./docker/README.md)

</details>

For Windows issues, check here first: [Windows Installation Guide](./docs/windows_guide.md)

### 1.2. Login

First time requires manual login to save RedNote login status.

**Using Binary Files:**

```bash
# Run the login tool for your platform
./xiaohongshu-login-darwin-arm64
```

**Using Source Code:**

```bash
go run cmd/login/main.go
```

### 1.3. Start MCP Service

Start xiaohongshu-mcp service.

**Using Binary Files:**

```bash
# Default: Headless mode, no browser interface
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64

# Non-headless mode, with browser interface
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64 -headless=false
```

**Using Source Code:**

```bash
# Default: Headless mode, no browser interface
go run .

# Non-headless mode, with browser interface
go run . -headless=false
```

**Configure a proxy (optional)**:

If you need to go through a proxy, set the `XHS_PROXY` environment variable:

```bash
# Start with a proxy configured
XHS_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxy:port ./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64

# Or from source
XHS_PROXY=http://proxy:port go run .
```

HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxies are supported, and proxy credentials are automatically masked in the logs.

**Optional authentication**:

Authentication is disabled by default. In production, configure it with the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable; a non-empty startup flag takes precedence, while an empty value falls back to `AUTH_TOKEN`.

```bash
# Environment variable
AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token ./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64
AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token go run .

# Non-empty startup flag (takes precedence over the environment variable)
./xiaohongshu-mcp-darwin-arm64 -token=your-secret-token
go run . -token=your-secret-token
```

When authentication is enabled, every MCP client must configure the custom request header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Command-line arguments may be visible in process listings, so prefer `AUTH_TOKEN` in deployment environments.

For example, MCP clients that support custom request headers can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xiaohongshu-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:18060/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer your-secret-token" }
    }
  }
}
```

## 1.4. Verify MCP

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

![Run Inspector](./assets/run_inspect.png)

After running, open the red-marked link, configure MCP inspector, enter `http://localhost:18060/mcp`, and click the `Connect` button.

<img width="915" height="659" alt="bf9532dd0b7ba423491accf511a467de" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08bc3cef-73e7-42d2-b923-7ba9e6c8af30" />

**Note:** Check if the options in the left sidebar are correct.

After configuring MCP inspector as above, click the `List Tools` button to view all Tools.

```

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>OpenClaw (via MCPorter)</b></summary>

> Make sure xiaohongshu-mcp is already deployed locally before you start. Handing the GitHub link to OpenClaw and letting it deploy the project for you is **not recommended**.

Since OpenClaw does not natively support MCP yet, the officially recommended way to call MCP services is through **MCPorter**.

> 💡 **Tip:** MCPorter is not the ideal way to call MCP — you may run into compatibility issues along the way, so please be aware.

#### Installation and Setup

Just hand the following three commands to OpenClaw in one go (via the Control UI, Telegram, Feishu, etc.), and OpenClaw will set up MCPorter for you.

```
npm i -g mcporter
npx mcporter config add xiaohongshu-mcp http://localhost:18060/mcp
npx mcporter list xiaohongshu-mcp
```

Once that is done, you can use every xiaohongshu-mcp feature from OpenClaw through natural language.

### 2.4. Usage Examples

Using Claude Code to publish content to RedNote:

**Example 1: Using HTTP Image Links**

```
Help me write a post to publish on RedNote,
with image: https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaoriRock_EN-US6499689741_UHD.jpg&w=3840
The image is: "Maori rock carving at Ngātoroirangi Mine Bay, Lake Taupo, New Zealand (© Joppi/Getty Images)"

Use xiaohongshu-mcp for publishing.
```

**Example 2: Using Local Image Paths (Recommended)**

```
Help me write a post about spring to publish on RedNote,
using these local images:
- /Users/username/Pictures/spring_flowers.jpg
- /Users/username/Pictures/cherry_blossom.jpg

Use xiaohongshu-mcp for publishing.
```

**Example 3: Publishing Video Content**

```
Help me write a video post about cooking tutorials to publish on RedNote,
using this local video file:

### 2.5. 💬 MCP FAQ

---

> ⚠️ The following are known risks when using OpenClaw + MCPorter. Please read them carefully before you start:

- OpenClaw's automated AI deployment behavior is outside the scope of this project's maintenance, and its results cannot be guaranteed
- As an intermediate layer, MCPorter may introduce additional compatibility issues that have nothing to do with xiaohongshu-mcp itself
- If you hit connection failures or abnormal tool calls, please check MCPorter's own configuration first instead of filing an Issue
- Before asking in the community or the groups, please confirm whether the problem also reproduces **without OpenClaw**

If you do not specifically need OpenClaw, we strongly recommend switching to a client with native HTTP MCP support such as [Claude Code CLI](#claude-code-cli), [Cursor](#cursor) or [Cline](#cline) — the experience is much more stable.

---

**Q:** Why does the check login username display `xiaghgngshu-mcp`?
**A:** The username is hardcoded.

---

**Q:** It shows publish success but the post doesn't actually appear?
**A:** Troubleshooting steps:

1. Re-publish using **non-headless mode**.
2. Try publishing with **different content**.
3. Login to RedNote web version and check if the account has been **restricted from web publishing due to risk control**.
4. Check if the **image size** is too large.
5. Make sure there are **no Chinese characters in the image path**.
6. If using network image URLs, confirm the **image links are accessible**.

---

**Q:** The MCP program crashes on my device, how to resolve?
**A:**

1. It is recommended to **build from source**.
2. Or use **Docker to install xiaohongshu-mcp**, refer to:
   - [Install xiaohongshu-mcp with Docker](https://github.com/xpzouying/xiaohongshu-mcp#:~:text=%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F%E4%B8%89%EF%BC%9A%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%20Docker%20%E5%AE%B9%E5%99%A8%EF%BC%88%E6%9C%80%E7%AE%80%E5%8D%95%EF%BC%89)
   - [X-MCP Project Page](https://github.com/xpzouying/x-mcp/)

---

**Q:** When verifying MCP with `http://localhost:18060/mcp`, it shows connection error?
**A:**

- In a **Docker environment**, please use
  [http://host.docker.internal:18060/mcp](http://host.docker.internal:18060/mcp)
- In a **non-Docker environment**, please use your **local IPv4 address** to access.
